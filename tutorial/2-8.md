##### Step 8: Re-deploy and mint a token

So now we've got a great metadata API endpoint and we don't have to do anything to service it. We know that it will be quick and cheap to serve up our content. We've even got an amazing website that has been minified and seeded across a Content Delivery Network. All we're missing is our Token!

When we deployed our Token we were using a metadata endpoint that returned `https://domain.com/metadata/{tokenId}`but `domain.com` isn't our domain! Looks like we'll have to update our metadata endpoint! 

Thank goodness we built in that ability as well a migration for doing just that. So let's go back to our `Metadata.sol` contract and update the URI with our nice and pretty netlify subdomain!

```solidity
function tokenURI(uint _tokenId) public view returns (string _infoUrl) {
    string memory base = "https://block-workshop.netlify.com/metadata/";
    string memory id = uint2str(_tokenId);
    return base.toSlice().concat(id.toSlice());
}
```

Now let's run our migration so that only the metadata is replaced, and updated inside of the contract

```bash
$ truffle migrate --network rinkeby -f 3 --to 3

...

Using network 'rinkeby'.

Now let's go back to our etherscan certified token and mint our first token!

You'll see that our `updateMetadata` transaction is listed there now

Since I'm using a metamask account that is the same as my deploy account I should have permission to mint a token. I'll go to the write contract tab, authenticate with metamask, and do just that : )

Since I added my own address to be the recipient I should be the proud owner of token #1. I can check using the token view of etherscan we saw before.

Wow! There's a token.

Let's jump over to opensea and see if they've noticed that we exist. With both rarebits and open sea you have to request for your token to be tracked before it shows up in the sidebar, but you can skip that by hard coding the contract address in to the URL. Let's try it knowing our token address is at `0x1170a2c7d4913d399f74ee5270ac65730ff961bf` and our token Id is `1`. We should be able to visit the rinkeby version of the URL like this:

WOW ðŸŽ‰

They even know our token's zodiac sign!

Let's add it to the app officially and we can see it in the rinkeby section

Let's add it to rarebits too!

Commit your code and push to git : )

```bash
git add . && git commit -m 'Step 7: Re-deploy and mint a token' && git push
```

### Complete!

**Bonus**: Make your background change color depending on the number of the ID (more interesting than modulo 256^2 on the id)

**Bonus**: Go over the assembly in the delegate call function

**Bonus**: Go over the `uint2str` function

**Bonus**: make a more interesting token!
